We want to examine how this discourse can be used more widely across the university community.  In this workshop, graduate student participants will learn how to maximize their own leadership strengths and harness those strengths to become more effective instructors.  We will also discuss how to create more successful group work experiences for students through understanding how different strengths work together in group dynamics.  Participants will receive a free copy of StrengthsFinder 2.0 and will take an on-line strengths assessment survey before attending the workshop and should bring their results report to the workshop.  We hope to expand this workshop into an on-going learning community in which members meet throughout the year to discuss strengths-based leadership and its impact in the classroom.\n\nThis workshop will be co-facilitated by Lisa Kelly, Associate Director of the Center for Teaching, and LaShelle Morrison, PhD student in Educational Psychology\n\n \n\nRegistration is required because space is limited. Feel free to bring your lunch to sessions during the noon hour.\n\n \n\nThe Center for Teaching promotes the enhancement of instruction at The University of Iowa through workshops, class visits, one-on-one consultation, group discussion, and intensive teaching-and learning institutes. Please let us know if you have a question and we will talk with you about solutions.\n\nIndividuals with disabilities are encouraged to attend all University of Iowa-sponsored events.
